## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my attempt at this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). Are where these challenges are hosted.

**This challenge includes HTML and CSS**

## Where to find everything

The task was to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder.

If you would like the Sketch file in order to see sizes etc, it is available to download from the challenge page.

All optimised assets used are in the `/images` folder.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information for color palette and fonts.


I used version control  through the command line to create the GitHub repository for this challenge.

## Suggested workflow

Below is the workflow process I used to complete the challenges, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). This will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need some help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to GitHub Pages. If you're not sure how to do this, [read through this guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages).
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes that you could create to make reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.
